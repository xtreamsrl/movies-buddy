    "In the previous section of this workshop, we discussed the importance of embedding a language's semantics in vectors (typically with hundreds of dimensions). These vector representations are not simply meant to be used as inputs to train deep learning models: there are multiple, key applications in search and recommendation without much machine learning - just similarity search. For example, Spotify heavily uses [vector search](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/03/introducing-natural-language-search-for-podcast-episodes/) to power its features.\n",

The bottleneck, in the end, is always speed: that's why vector databases are so popular. What are they, why are they necessary, and how do they work? Let's get started!"

HNSW constructs a multi-layered graph where each layer is a more coarse-grained approximation of the data. Searches start at the top layer using these broad shortcuts, then move down to increasingly finer details, making the search efficient even in very large datasets. It's akin to starting from a bird's-eye view of the city and zooming in step-by-step to your destination.\n",

This process creates a set of trees where similar items are likely to end up in the same leaf or nearby leaves. When querying, ANNOY traverses these trees, quickly narrowing down the areas where the nearest neighbors are likely to be found. It's like having a map where similar things are grouped together, and finding what you want becomes faster because you know which area to look in.\n",

    "**Type**: Hash-based\n",
    "**How It Works**: Imagine trying to find documents with similar topics in a huge library. Instead of reading through each, you could assign a unique stamp to each document based on its main themes. Documents with similar themes would have similar stamps, making it easier to find related documents just by comparing stamps. LSH works by transforming data points into a hash code such that similar items are more likely to be hashed to the same \"bucket\" or a nearby bucket. During a search, only items in the same or adjacent buckets are compared, significantly speeding up the search process for similar items. It’s a way of organizing items so that one can quickly find items in the same category without exhaustive search.\n",
