    "## A Bit of History\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive way to do this, is to **map every word in a dictionary to a number**. That is, map a sentence like \"Applied Machine Learning Days are a super cool conference\" to a list of integers like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[10, 40, 5, 10, 7, 8, 90, 123, 2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called **encoding**, and this is a very simple encoding method. However, for complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, this is not sufficient. For example, here the word `cool` is used to denote something that is excellent, admirable. But `cool` can also mean \"almost cold\", or even \"relaxed\": how can we disambiguate?\n",
    "\n",
    "To make another, slightly more complex example, take the two pair of words (\"man\", \"woman\") and (\"king\", \"queen\"). We know there is a relationship between those concepts: paraphrasing the words of a [very famous research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781), we might want our encoding method to have this property: encoding(\"King\") - encoding(\"Man\") + encoding(\"Woman\") ~= encoding(\"Queen\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we would want our encoding method to carry the semantic relationship between words. In 2013, the four authors of the paper came up with Word2Vec: a neural network capable of generating dense vector representations, called *embeddings*, from words, capturing a significant amount of language semantic. You can imagine that the encoding perform this mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Queen\" = [0.3, 0.3, 0.2, ..., 0.3]\n",
    "\"King\" = [0.5, -0.3, 0.1, ..., 0.5]\n",
    "\"Man\" = [0.2, 0.95, 0.3, ..., 0.1]\n",
    "\"Woman\" = [0.56, -0.5, 0.32, ..., 0.1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the number of dimensions of each vector is the same for every word (which is yet another desireable feature from our encoding algorithm) and is used to \"place\" every word in an Euclidean space. During training, such neural networks adjust the position of every word in the vector space, and produce a representation that carries the semantic proximity of the terms of the data it was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, such models have evolved beyond embedding words alone. Now, for example, it is possible to encode sentences altogether (and this is what we'll do!), as well as images, text and images, as well as audio tracks. But talk is cheap! Let's get our hands dirty, and make our computer understand language!"
